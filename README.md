# SkyTest Docker Image

## Overview

This Docker image packages the SkyTest application, a Flask-based web application designed for [describe the main functionality or purpose of your application]. It provides an easy setup and deployment on any system with Docker support, encapsulating the application and its dependencies in a portable container.

The source code and detailed documentation for SkyTest, along with additional resources and a demo, are available on GitHub: [alireza787b/SkyTest](https://github.com/alireza787b/SkyTest). This Docker image is built from the latest stable release of the SkyTest repository to ensure it includes the most recent features and updates.

## Quick Start

To get SkyTest up and running with Docker, ensure Docker is installed on your system. For Docker installation instructions, refer to the official [Getting Started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) guide.

Run the following command to start SkyTest in a Docker container:

```sh
docker run -d -p <host_port>:5562 alireza787b/skytest:latest
```

Replace `<host_port>` with the port number on your host machine you'd like to use to access SkyTest. For example, to access the application at `localhost:8080`, you would use:

```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:5562 alireza787b/skytest:latest
```

SkyTest will now be accessible at `http://localhost:<host_port>`, where `<host_port>` is the port number you specified.
